    <div class="question">
        <h2>How can i install the plugin into an existing eclipse build?<span class="sub">(Zend Studio, Aptana, FlashBuilder, [enter your build here])</span></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="answer">
        <p>The Twig editor is based on the PHP Development Tools <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project.php">PDT</a>. Therefore, any eclipse build which does not ship with built-in PDT needs to be configured to allow the twig plugin 
		to resolve the PDT dependency.</p>     
        <p>So if your Eclipse build does not come with a pre-installed version of PDT, make sure that the default eclipse updatesite (currently Indigo) is available in your installation.</p>
